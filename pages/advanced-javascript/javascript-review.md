# Course Overview

Welcome to the Advanced JavaScript course! The focus of this course is React and using JavaScript Frameworks to build modern web applications. However, before we dive into React, we need to ensure you have a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

For most of you, it's been a few weeks (or months) since you last wrote JavaScript. So, the focus of this first week is to review the JavaScript concepts you learned in the Modern JavaScript course. This will help you get back into the swing of things and prepare you for the more advanced topics we'll cover later in the course.

# Necessary Software

Before we start reviewing, please make sure you have all of the same software installed that you did for the Modern JavaScript course. If you need help with this, please refer to the [Software Used in this Course](https://fvtc.software/appel/modern-javascript/getting-started#software-used-in-this-course) section of the Modern JavaScript course.


# JavaScript Review

In this section, we'll review some of the key concepts from the Modern JavaScript course. This will include functions, array methods, and higher-order functions. If you need a refresher on any of these topics, please refer to the [Modern JavaScript course content](https://fvtc.software/appel/modern-javascript).

Here is the code from the video:

```javascript

const numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

// Function to double a number
const double = num => num * 2

// Using map to apply the double function to each element in the array

```
