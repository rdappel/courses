# Advanced JavaScript Research Project

For this project, you will research a JavaScript technology beyond what we covered in class, preferably related to React. You will follow tutorials, build a working demo application, and present your findings to the class.

> [!IMPORTANT] Make sure that you have had your topic approved by your instructor before starting work on your project!

## Initial Investigation Assignment

### Week 12: Technology Exploration

Before selecting a final topic, you will conduct an initial investigation into three potential technologies. This will help you make an informed decision and ensure you understand the project scope. Your investigation should include:

- A brief overview of each technology (1-2 paragraphs per technology).
- Key features and use cases.
- Potential challenges in implementation.
- Available learning resources (tutorials, documentation, articles).
- Your final choice and a backup option, with a short explanation of why you selected them.

## Contributing to the Project

1. **Choose a Technology**: Select a JavaScript-related technology, framework, or library. While it is recommended to choose something React-related, other JavaScript topics are acceptable with approval. Some possible options:
   - State management (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil)
   - UI Libraries (Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS with React)
   - Server-Side Rendering (Next.js)
   - Static Site Generation (Astro, Gatsby)
   - Authentication (Auth0, Firebase Auth, Clerk)
   - Data Fetching (React Query, SWR, Apollo GraphQL)
   - WebSockets (Socket.io, WebRTC)
   - Testing (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress)
   - Animations (Framer Motion, GSAP)
   - Others (Three.js, D3.js, Electron, Expo for React Native)

2. **Research & Learn**: 
   - Find at least **3 tutorials or articles** on your chosen topic.
   - Document key concepts, integration with JavaScript/React, and common use cases.
   - Maintain a list of resources, including articles, videos, documentation, and any relevant tools.

3. **Build a Demo Application**: 
   - Apply what youâ€™ve learned by building a **small but functional application** demonstrating the technology.
   - Your demo should:
     - Have a clear purpose and show off core features.
     - Be well-structured and use best practices.
     - Be deployed (if applicable) or easily runnable on a local machine.

4. **Write a Report**: 
   Your report should be **2-4 pages** and include:
   - **Introduction:** What technology did you choose? Why?
   - **Key Features:** Summary of what it does and its use cases.
   - **Implementation:** How you integrated it into your demo app.
   - **Challenges & Learnings:** What was difficult? What did you learn?
   - **Resources & References:** List the tutorials, articles, and any other sources used.

5. **Present Your Findings**: 
   - Prepare a **5-10 minute presentation** for the class.
   - Demo your application and explain how it works.
   - Share insights from your research and learning process.

> [!NOTE] Each student must contribute fully to the project. Documentation and demonstration of work are mandatory.

## Submission

When you are finished with your project, you will need to submit the following:

1. **GitHub Repository Link**: Provide a link to your repository containing the demo application.
2. **Report**: Upload your research report in PDF format.
3. **Presentation**: Be prepared to present your findings during the final project session.

## Grading

Your project will be graded based on the following criteria:

- **Initial Investigation (10 pts)**: Depth of preliminary research and clarity of final selection.
- **Research (20 pts)**: Depth of research, quality of sources, and understanding demonstrated.
- **Demo Application (30 pts)**: Functionality, integration of the technology, and best practices.
- **Report (25 pts)**: Clarity, structure, depth of explanation, and documentation.
- **Presentation (15 pts)**: Clarity, engagement, demonstration of knowledge, and professionalism.

> [!NOTE] I will not grade broken projects. If your application does not run or compile, you will receive a 0, and I will leave a comment for you to fix it.
