Proposed week/order  

Competencies/Tasks 

- Possible exercises/assignments 

Week 1 

 Install and setup git (update credentials, etc) 

Init local 

Staging (add files) and committing 

Delete .git file (unhook from sc) 

Register for Github (edu) 
Register for Azure DevOps... others? 

Week 2 

Create and link remote 

Push (first time and then follow up) 

Fork a public repo 

Managing access to private repos  

Clone 

Status 

.gitignore file / readme.md 

 

Create a webpage and push it up to private repo (add the instructor to the repo) 

Fork an instructor repo (public) and add their name to it, then push it up 

Create a readme file, and a .gitignore so the readme doesn't get pushed up 

This might be too much for 1 week... could move something to week 3 




Week 3 

 Git pull (handle merge conflicts) 

We create a scenario where the student clones a project and changes it, the instructor (or another student?) also changes it. 

This requires a pull (merge) before the student can push 

 

Week 4 

Pull requests 

Fork an instructor repo (maybe html?), clone it down, add some code, then create a PR 

Week 5 

Branches and Merging 

Fork & Clone a project, checkout dev branch, create a feature branch. 

Diff Merge feature into dev (which has been changed, so dev->feature, then feature->dev) 

Create a PR for the dev branch 

Week 6 

Stashing (list, pop, drop)  

Make changes to a repo, stash them, create another change, push the latest change, 

Then pop the stash 

 

Week 7 

Review for exam and (Start "project"?) 

 

Week 8 or 9  

Work on or finish project and take Exam 

 

(not sure if 1cr is 8 or 9 weeks)  



Project Idea: Team of 3 or 4 create a private repo with the following: 

index.html -- "homepage for group" 

ryan-appel.html -- "page for each team member" 

readme.md 

Each team member is responsible for cloning and adding their own page and linking it to the index 

Each team member is also responsible for adding to the readme, and managing any merge conflicts 

The instructor could do a pull request (pre-made html that you can just drop in, we could probably even script this) 

The students would have to accept or deny the request.
