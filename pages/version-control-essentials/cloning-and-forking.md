# Cloning a Repository

Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository onto your local machine, so you can work on it.

In this video, we will walk through the process of cloning a repository from GitHub:

<details open>
	<summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
	<div class="video-container">
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wtl5GD73xrg" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
			allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
		</iframe>
	</div>
</details>

The command to clone a repository is:

```bash
git clone <remote-url>
```

# Forking a Repository

Forking is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to the repository without affecting the original repository. Forking is commonly used in open-source projects, where you want to contribute to a project but don't have write access to the original repository.

In this video, we will walk through the process of forking a repository on GitHub:

> [!NOTE] If you want to follow along, the repository we are forking is [js-movie-api](https://github.com/fvtc/js-movie-api).

# Real-World Example

In this video I will talk about a real-world example of how you can use forking and cloning to contribute to an open-source project:
