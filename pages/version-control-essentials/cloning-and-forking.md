# Cloning a Repository

Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository onto your local machine, so you can work on it.

In this video, we will walk through the process of cloning a repository from GitHub:

<details open>
	<summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
	<div class="video-container">
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
			allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
		</iframe>
	</div>
</details>

The command to clone a repository is:

```bash
git clone <remote-url>
```
