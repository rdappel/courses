# Getting Started

## What is Git?

Before we start using Git, let's take a moment to understand what it is, and why it is so popular. Over 70% of developers worldwide use Git. Git is a free, open-source version control system.

## What does it do?

Git allows you to keep track of changes to your code. It allows you to see who made changes, when they made them, and what changes they made. This is useful when working on a project with multiple people, as it allows you to collaborate more effectively.

This video will give you a brief overview of Git and its features:

Additionally, Git allows you to create branches, which are separate versions of your code. This allows you to work on new features without affecting the main codebase. Once you are finished with your changes, you can merge them back into the main codebase.

## Terminology

Let's go over some of the terminology used in Git:

- **Git**: Git is the version control system that we will be using. It is a program that allows you to keep track of changes to your code.

- **Repository**: A repository is a collection of files and folders that make up your project. It is stored on your computer and contains all of the information about your project, including the history of changes to your code.

- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. I like to think of a commit as a save point in a video game. If something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous commit.

- **Local Repository**: A local repository is a repository that is stored on your computer. This allows you to keep track of changes to your code.

- **Remote Repository**: A remote repository is a repository that is stored on a server. This allows you to collaborate with others and share your code with them.

# Installing Git

## Is Git Already Installed?

You can quickly check to see if git is installed on your computer, and which version. Simply open a terminal (or command prompt) and type the following command:

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number, then Git is already installed on your computer. If you see an error message or if your version is less than 2.30, you will need to install Git.

If you haven't run commands from a terminal before, you can watch this video to learn how:
