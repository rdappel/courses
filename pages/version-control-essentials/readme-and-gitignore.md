# Readme Files and .gitignore

This unit will cover how to contribute to open-source projects. Before you can contribute however, you need to know about two important files: the `README.md` file and the `.gitignore` file.

# Readme Files

A `README.md` file is a markdown file that contains information about a project. It is typically the first file that people see when they visit a repository, and it should provide an overview of the project, how to install it, how to use it, and how to contribute to it. Additionally, it can include links to documentation, issues, and other resources related to the project.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple syntax. It is widely used for writing documentation, README files, and other text-based content. Markdown files typically have a `.md` extension.

Markdown is kind of like a simplified version of HTML. It allows you to format text using special characters, such as `#` for headings, `-` for bullet points, and `**` for bold text. Markdown is easy to read and write, and it can be converted to HTML or other formats.

## Creating a README.md File

To create a `README.md` file, you can use any text editor or IDE. Here is an example of a simple `README.md` file:

```markdown
# Project Title

A brief description of your project.

## Installation

Instructions for installing the project.

## Usage

Instructions for using the project.

## Contributing

Instructions for contributing to the project.
```

This video will show you how to create a `README.md` file:

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        </iframe>
    </div>
</details>

The repository that I showed in the video is [fvtc/choose-your-adventure](https://github.com/fvtc/choose-your-adventure).

> [!NOTE] For Assignment 2, you created a fork of tchapi's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet). You can refer to that repository for a quick reference on how to do common formatting tasks in Markdown.

# .gitignore Files

A `.gitignore` file is a text file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project. It is used to prevent certain files from being tracked by Git, such as build artifacts, temporary files, and sensitive information.

## Why Use a .gitignore File?

Using a `.gitignore` file is important because it helps keep your repository clean and free of unnecessary files. It also helps protect sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords, from being accidentally committed to the repository.

## Creating a .gitignore File

To create a `.gitignore` file, you can use any text editor or IDE. Here is an example of a simple `.gitignore` file:

```
# Ignore these folders (and their contents)
build/
dist/

# Ignore these files
secret.txt
config.json

# Ignore files with these extensions
*.tmp
*.log
```

This video will show you how to create a `.gitignore` file:

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        </iframe>
    </div>
</details>

> [!NOTE] Some IDEs, such as Visual Studio will automatically create a `.gitignore` file for you when you create a new project. You can also find pre-made `.gitignore` files for many common programming languages and frameworks on [GitHub's gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

# Exercise 1

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        </iframe>
    </div>
</details>

For this exercise, you will create a `README.md` file and a `.gitignore` file for your demo1 repository. You can use the examples provided in this unit as a starting point.

Once you have created the files, commit them to your repository and push the changes to GitHub.

## Solution {#exercise-1-solution}

<details>
    <summary>Show the Answer</summary>

Here is the README file that I created for this exercise:

```markdown
# Demo1 Repository

This is a demo repository for the **Version Control Essentials** course.

## Usage

As this is a demo repository, there is no specific usage for it. However, you can use it to practice using Git and GitHub.

## Contributing

I don't actually expect anyone to contribute to this repository...
```

Here is the `.gitignore` file that I created for this exercise:

```plaintext
# Ignore anything in the secrets folder
secrets/
```
