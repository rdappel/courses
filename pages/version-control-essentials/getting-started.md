# Getting Started

As a software developer, or a web developer, you will be working on projects that involve multiple files and multiple people. Keeping track of changes, managing versions, and collaborating with others can be a challenge. This is where version control comes in.

The most popular version control system is Git. Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage your projects.

You will need to install Git on your computer in order to use it. You can download Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).

It should automatically select the correct version for your operating system. If not, you can choose the correct version from the dropdown.

This video will walk you through the installation process:

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        </iframe>
    </div>
</details>

> [!IMPORTANT] Make sure to select the correct options during the installation process. You can leave most of the options at their default settings.

## Setting Up Git

Once you have Git installed, you will need to configure it with your name and email address. This information will be used to identify you when you make changes to your code.

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:


<div class="no-copy">

```php
$test = "Hello World";
echo $test;
```

</div>
