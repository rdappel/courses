1. Visit the [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) repository on GitHub. This is a great project for beginners to practice contributing to open-source.

2. Fork the repository to your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

3. Open the cloned repository in your code editor, and navigate to the `Contributors.md` file. This file contains a list of contributors to the project.

4. Add your name (linked to your GitHub profile), along with a message to the people of GitHub.

5. Commit your changes, and push them to your forked repository.

6. Create a pull request from your forked repository to the original `firstcontributions/first-contributions` repository.

# Submission

Once you have created your pull request, submit the link to your pull request in Blackboard.

> [!NOTE] Your pull request may not be merged immediately. Be patient and check back later to see if it has been merged.
