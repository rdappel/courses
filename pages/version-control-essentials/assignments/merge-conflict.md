# Instructions

## Part 1: Create a Repository

1. **Create a new project**: Create a new folder for this assignment and call it `your-name-assignment-4`. For example, `john-doe-assignment-4`.

2. **Create an index.html file**: Inside your project folder, create a file called `index.html`. This file will contain the code that you and your partner will work on.

3. **Add some content**: Add some basic HTML content to the `index.html` file. You can use the following code as a starting point:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Assignment 4 - Merge Conflict</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1></h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML file for the merge conflict assignment.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

4. **Add your name**: Replace the `<h1></h1>` tag with your name. For example, `<h1>John Doe</h1>`. Then save your changes and view the file in your web browser to ensure it displays correctly.

5. **Push your code to GitHub**: Using what you've learned over the past couple of weeks, initialize your project as a Git repository, commit your changes, and push the code to a new remote repository on GitHub. Make sure to name the repository something like `your-name-merge-conflict`, or `your-name-assignment-4`.
