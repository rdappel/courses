For this assignment you are going to create an Azure DevOps account, and add your instructor as a member of your organization. This will allow you to use Azure DevOps for your projects, and will also allow your instructor to see your work.

## Register or Sign In

> [!IMPORTANT] You will not need to enter a credit card or payment information. By using your fvtc.edu email address, you will be able to create a free Azure DevOps organization that is sufficient for this course. If you are prompted to enter a credit card or payment information, please do not proceed! Instead, contact your instructor for assistance.

1. Go to [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/repos/) and Sign in with your fvtc.edu email address.

2. You should see a prompt to create an organization. If you don't see this prompt, click on the "New organization" button.

3. For the organization name, use your first and last name (e.g., "ryan-appel"). This will help keep things organized and make it easier for your instructor to find your work.

4. Follow the prompts to complete the organization creation process. **DO NOT enter a credit card or payment information.** Azure DevOps offers a free tier that is sufficient for this course.

## Create a Project

1. Once your organization is created, you should be prompted to create a new project. If not, click on the "New project" button.

2. Name your project "Version Control Essentials". You can leave all of the other settings at their default values.

## Add Your Instructor

1. Go to your Azure DevOps organization settings (Not the project settings). You can find this by clicking on the blue "Azure DevOps" logo in the top left corner, then selecting "Organization settings" on the bottom left.

2. In the organization settings, click on "Users" in the left sidebar.

3. Click on the "Add users" button, and search for your instructor by their LAST NAME (e.g., "Doe"). You should see your instructor's name appear in the search results (e.g., "Doe, John"). If you see results that say "Admin" next to them, DO NOT select those. Instead, look for the one that says "Doe, John".

4. Confirm that the Access level is set to "Basic."

5. In the "Add to project" section, select the project you just created ("Version Control Essentials").

6. Uncheck the "Send email invitation" option. This is not necessary, as your instructor will be able to access your organization directly.

# Submission

Submit the URL to your Azure DevOps organization in Blackboard. The URL should look like: `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization-name`.
