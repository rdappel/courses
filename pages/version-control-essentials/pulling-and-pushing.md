# Pulling and Pushing

In this section, we will learn how to pull and push changes to a remote repository. Pulling means getting the latest changes from the remote repository, while pushing means sending your changes to the remote repository. We have actually already pushed code to a remote repository in the previous section, but we will go over it again here in greater depth.`

## Pulling Changes

Generally, you will want to pull changes from the remote repository before you start working on your code. This ensures that you have the latest version of the code and that you are not working on an outdated version.

This video will show you how to perform a pull, and cover some of the common situations when you might need to pull changes:

## Pushing Changes

As mentioned earlier, you already pushed changes to a remote repository in the previous section. However, there are some situations where pushing changes might fail. This video will show you some of the common situations where pushing changes might fail, and how to resolve them:
