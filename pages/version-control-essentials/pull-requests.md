# Pull Requests

Pull requests are a fundamental feature of Git hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. They provide a way to propose changes to a repository and facilitate code review and collaboration. In this section, we'll learn how to create, review, and merge pull requests.

## Creating a Pull Request

Before you can create a pull request, you need to have a fork of the repository you want to contribute to. After cloning the repository and making your changes, you can create a pull request to propose those changes to the original repository.

This video will walk you through the process of creating a pull request on GitHub:

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        </iframe>
    </div>
</details>

When creating a pull request, you typically follow these steps:

## Writing Good Pull Request Descriptions

A good pull request description should include:

- **Title**: A clear, concise title that summarizes the changes

- **Description**: Detailed explanation of what was changed and why

- **Testing**: Information about how the changes were tested

- **Screenshots**: Visual changes should include before/after screenshots

- **Related Issues**: Reference any issues that the PR addresses

## Reviewing Pull Requests

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        </iframe>
    </div>
</details>

When reviewing pull requests, consider:

- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-written and maintainable?

- **Functionality**: Do the changes work as expected?

- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests for the changes?

- **Documentation**: Is documentation updated if needed?

- **Style**: Does the code follow the project's style guidelines?

### Types of Review Comments

- **Approval**: The changes look good and can be merged

- **Request Changes**: Issues that must be addressed before merging

- **Comment**: General feedback or suggestions

## Merging Pull Requests

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        </iframe>
    </div>
</details>

> [!NOTE] As a student contributing to open-source projects, you typically won't be the one merging pull requests. The project maintainers will review your PR and merge it if it meets their standards.

## Pull Request Best Practices

- **Keep PRs Small**: Smaller pull requests are easier to review and less likely to cause issues

- **Use Descriptive Titles**: Make it clear what the PR does

- **Write Clear Descriptions**: Explain the what, why, and how of your changes

- **Update Documentation**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes

- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure your changes work and don't break existing functionality

- **Be Responsive**: Respond to feedback and questions promptly

- **Follow Project Guidelines**: Adhere to the project's contribution guidelines
