# Introduction to Git

## What is Git?

Before we start using Git, let's take a moment to understand what it is, and why it is so popular. Over 70% of developers worldwide use Git. Git is a free, open-source version control system.

## What does it do?

Git allows you to keep track of changes to your code. It allows you to see who made changes, when they made them, and what changes they made. This is useful when working on a project with multiple people, as it allows you to collaborate more effectively.

This video will give you a brief overview of Git and its features:

Some of the ways that we will be using Git in this course include:

- Keeping track of changes to our code

- Collaborating with others

- Creating branches to work on new features

- Merging changes back into the main codebase

## Terminology

Let's go over some of the terminology used in Git:

- **Git**: Git is software that allows you to keep track of changes to your code. It is a free, open-source version control system. It has become the standard for version control in the software development industry. In the next section, we will check to see if Git is already installed on your computer, and if not, we will install it.

- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. I like to think of a commit as a save point in a video game. If something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous commit.

- **Repository**: A (local) repository is a collection of files and folders that make up your project. It is stored on your computer and contains all of the information about your project, including the history of changes to your code.

- **Remote Repository**: A remote repository is a repository that is stored on a server. This allows you to collaborate with others and share your code with them. In this course, we will be using GitHub and Azure DevOps to host our remote repositories. These are the two most popular platforms for hosting Git repositories, though there are many others.
