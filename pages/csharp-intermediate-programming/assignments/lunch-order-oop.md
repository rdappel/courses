# Assignment 3 - Lunch Order using OOP

For this assignment youâ€™ll be modifying the previous lunch order form to use object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## Project Setup

Clone your previous lunch order project repository if needed. Then create a branch for this assignment called `feature/oop`.

Create a new project called `<your-initials>.LunchOrder.BL` for the business logic layer.

## Operation

The application should work exactly like the previous version.

## Specifications

- The application should use classes and objects to represent the main course and add-on items.

- The business logic layer should contain all the calculation logic.

- The UI layer should only handle user input and display output.

- Your BL should have a collection object to store the main courses. It should contain a `Populate()` method to initialize the collection with sample data.

# Submission

Push your code to the Azure DevOps repository and submit the URL to Blackboard.
