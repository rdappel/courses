# Advanced Routing and MongoDB

As ExpressJS applications grow in complexity, it becomes necessary to organize your routes into separate files. This allows you to break your application into smaller, more manageable pieces, and makes it easier to maintain and update your code.

In this unit, we will learn how to create a modular ExpressJS application that uses MongoDB to store and retrieve data.

# Modular Routing

In the previous unit, we created a simple ExpressJS application that contained all of our routes in a single file. This works fine for small applications, but as your application grows, it can become difficult to manage all of your routes in a single file.

To solve this problem, we can break our routes into separate files and organize them into a folder structure that makes sense for our application. Take a look:
