# Assignment 2 - State Capitals

For this assignment you will create a WinForms application to display the greeting "Hello World! Welcome to Visual Studio ~ C#!".

<details open style="display: none;">
	<summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
	<div class="video-container">
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AAAAAAA" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
			allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
		</iframe>
	</div>
</details>

## Project Setup

Create a new Windows Forms App project in Visual Studio. Name the project `<your-initials>.StateCapitals.UI`, and the solution `<your-initials>.StateCapitals`. This will help keep your projects organized.

## Form Design

Arrange the controls to closely resemble the following image:

## Operation

1. When the user clicks on a given state button, the corresponding state and its capital should be displayed.

2. When the `Clear` button is clicked, the message in the label should be cleared, resulting in an empty label.

3. When the `Exit` button is clicked, the application should close.

## Specifications

1. Use correct naming conventions for your project, solution, and all controls.

2. Include appropriate comments in your code.

# Submission

Either show your instructor (classroom students), or push your code to the Azure DevOps repository and submit the URL to Blackboard.

> [!NOTE] If you don't know how to push your code to Azure DevOps, contact your instructor for assistance.
