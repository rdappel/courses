# Joining a Team

To join a team, you will need to use Microsoft Teams. If you have not already installed Teams, you can download it from [https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads).

Once you have installed Teams, start it up and log in with your school email address and password. The steps will vary depending on whether you are using "New Teams" or "Old Teams".

## New Teams

Click on the "Teams" tab on the left side of the screen. You will see a list of teams that you are a member of. At the top next to "Teams" there is a `+` button. Click on this button, and then click on "Join team". Then, enter the Join Code that your instructor posted in Blackboard. Click "Add team".

## Old Teams

Click on the "Teams" tab on the left side of the screen. You will see a list of teams that you are a member of. Click on the "Join or create team" button at the bottom of the list. Then, enter the Join Code that your instructor posted in Blackboard. Click "Join team".
